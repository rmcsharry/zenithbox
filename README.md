## Getting Started

First create a file called ".env.local" in the root folder.

Open this file and enter your OpenAI API key like this:

NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

Save the file.

Then run the development server:

```bash
npx next dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
